# AspectJ-Performance-Measurement-Framework

This is a simple measurement framework for aspect framework AspectJ.

Using this framework, one can measure following performance aspects
of AspectJ framework:
1. Performance overhead generated by Before, After and Around advices
2. Two usage patterns
   a. Coarse-grained usage
   n. Fine-grained usage

Two version are available in sources:
1. PC version
2. Mobile version (Android devices, televisions etc.)

To perform test without using any aspects, just compile and 
run AspectJBenchmark.java.

To use fine or coarse-grained approach, compile the sources using ajc
compiler of preffered version of AspectJ. For example, to compile fine-grained
approach:

> ajc AspectJBenchmark.java AspectFine.aj

To run tests, use following command:
> java -cp .;<aspectj_home>\lib\aspectjrt.jar;<aspectj_home>\lib\aspectjtools.jar;
<aspectj_home>\lib\aspectjweaver.jar;<aspectj_home>\lib\org.aspectj.matcher.jar AspectJBenchmark

We recommend using command line and not any intermediate way to run tests (e.g. an IDE).
We also recommend to shut down all unnecessary system processes and services, so the
tests are run in system with least possible interruptions.

Feel free to fork the repository and alter tests in any way you want.
Any feedback and suggestions are appreciated.
